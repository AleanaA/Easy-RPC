# Easy-RPC
Making Discord Rich Presence easy for everyone!

## Setup
Just head over to the Releases tab and download the latest exe!

You'll need to have made an [OAuth application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/), the name of which will be what displays as what you're playing. Copy the Client ID and after the program starts up, paste it in and click Submit.

Once you're in the main window, your status should have changed, and you should be able to set everything
The first box sets the top text in the rich presence, and the second box sets the bottom text in the rich presence

The large picture asset is the name of an asset you'll have to upload to the [OAuth application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and the large hover text is the text that appears when you hover over the large iamge.

The small picture asset and small hover text are both the exact same as the large variants, but are a smaller icon in the bottom right corner of the large image

After settings these variables, all of which are optional, click update, and your status will change!

Please keep in mind that both the CMD and the UI window that open must stay open for you to keep your status.
